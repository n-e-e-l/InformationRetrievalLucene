# InformationRetrievalLucene
Information Retrieval system takes the user query and outputs a file
relevant to the query of the user. It is similar to the search engines
we come across daily which displays the results based on the search
query of the user. This functionality is useful to get information from
tons of document and display the most matching results first.
